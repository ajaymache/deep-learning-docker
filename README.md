This repository aims at getting you started with [docker](https://www.docker.com/) by setting up environment for machine learning/deep learning libraries and frameworks.

### What is docker?
Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density. Enterprises use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server apps. (*source: www.docker.com*)
